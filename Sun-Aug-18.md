### Verses: John Chapter 9: 1 - 41

### Introduction:

It was 1987 when I saw my frist mountain I remembr I was young, and my family went on a family trip for us family trips where around Florida we went to TenneseeGalliberg. We viisted Ruby Falls, it is this 100 foot waterfal inside a cave and you walk inside for an hour and I remember I was cold and mesmerized, damp. Then the guide told us let us show you how dark the cave is without the light. He asked us to put our hands infront of our faces and said can you see your hands? We couldnt. I bring this memory from a vacation to tell tyou it is possible for us to have perfect vision and not see anything. It is possible for us to have 20/20 vision and not see anything. The idea of not seeing anything but having perfect vision iws a tragedy. THe fall is the biggest tragedy. The sin that disoriente made seeing things of God impossible. It is more than the inability to see it is the unwillingness to see. The stuborness to se ewhat is infront of you.

THe only thing worst than being blind is having sight but not vision. At the center of this blidnness is the heart that is hardened the heart that is at revbellion against God. Hear this foolish and senseless people you have eyes and see not, ears and hear not.

## Main Idea: Jesus, the light of the world, can remove the blindness and give us spiritual eyes to see.

This chapter is connected to 7 and 8, the feast of tabernacle that had showed the provision of God for his people. To remember the provision of God.

In John Chapter 8 God says it is I who have the light. The images that show the provision of God all point to JEsus that he is that river of flowing water for all who are thirsty and in this chapter of the man who was blind from birth. WHy is Jesus healing the man? It is almost as if Jesus is using this feast to make it all about himself.

## 1. Glorious Purpose (1-7):

Day after day people pass by the beggars. Jesus sees him and stop, the moment hacome. THe glorious moment of this interaction has come. Jesus's disciples are clueless. Jesus understands he is about to turn on the lights of this man. Before he turns on the light of this man, he also turns on the lights of his disciples. In verse 2, we see that the disciples see the same man Jesus see. THey have questions. They want to make sense of the situation so they try to bring soem rational to what is happening here. His disciples ask him "W@Ho sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind. They noticed that the man was blind from birth. A beggar. This was the mans reality but as the rest throught was because someone has sinned. They ask Jesus which is it? The discipels are excersing bad theology. Bad theology will get you in trouble quick. How many interpret suffering and difficulties of life as sin or unbelief. God must be punishing me. It most thedevil. All of that interpretation all of that way of seeing thins is bad theology.

DO we automatically say that every circumstance is because someone sinned? If you have that understanding you have bad theology. Jesus said, it is not that this man or his parents sinned. A good theology would sya this mans blindness was predestined from eternity past for a glorious purpose. Jesus said, that the works of God may be displayed in him. WHat are those works. Gods glorious plan of salvation. THe light who is among them. THe light of the world. THis man was born blind for this moment for this glorious purpose.

Bad theology gets you in trouble because they are man centered. God theology is GOd centered. Theology literally means the study of God. So when we see suffering we must ask how is God glorifying himself through this suffering, through this difficulty and how is Gods providence and soverignty at work in this moment. Jesus understood this. Now he will be glorified because he is GOd himself. Instead of having a theological conversation with the man jsut like the dicsipeld wanted. Jesus wanted to put the workds of God on display to manifet his work. He knows there is just a window of opportunity. We must work now. He must work while it is day, night is coming. One day night will come. When he dies in the cross until then he needs to put to display the works of God. To manifest the work of GOd. Notice how he said, we must work the works of him who sent me.

In Verse 6, Jesus put mud on the mans eyes, spit on dirt, puts it in the mans eyes. What is Jesus doing? Why is he doing that he putting in display a parable for everyone to understand that he is the obne that created us. For us to know that we are disrt that he molded us. The God of universe sees this man. He tells them to go wash in the pool of Sidom. It is believed that in this pool the preacher would poor the water and do a priestly act. The priest was sent to intercede. Now the feast of tabernacles is over and people is still over. The pool itself is "Sent" there is another pool fir the lay man. Jesus wants the man to know that the pool is not going to save him, the priest is not going to save him, only Jesus.

Christ himself is the only one who can do what God can do. He puts dirt in the mans eyes, and he goes and wash and sees. A miracle happened that should not have happened because nothing is for him to happen. The lights were turned on. Jesus is saying I am the one sernt by the father to give you light. The healing of this blind man was not just so that he an phisically see. The purpose was for this man to be a picture as he spiritually sees, this would be a pircture that only Jesus can do and all we can do is respond. We were all by nature blind. There is a glorious purpose with his healing.

## 2. Malicious Opposition (8 - 34)

The darkness wants to turn off the light of them whose eyes were opened. We see four different moments where this man is being addressed. THere are four conversations.

8 - 12: The man is interviewed by his neighbors who are confused. How can he be the blindman we known from birth. Is this the guy he kind of looks like him. In verse 9, he says, yes, I am the man that is me. The neighnors where blind to the blind man because he couldnt see it was him. The blind man says what he knew that a man called Jesus made mud annointed my eyes, told me to go to silom and wash and I received my sight. It was as simple as that. Sinners have a way of being unhappy when others are happy. So the evidence that the text tells us that they took him to the pharasees.

The pharasewes where the Sabbath police. They say Jesus broke the Sabbath. There is now great division on them. Every time they tried to get the blind man to speak he would say the same. I was blind and now I see. In verse 17, they say to the blind man what do you say about him? "He is a prophet".

In Verse 23, the pharasees bring their parents. They didnt defend their child or anything. In fear to not being removed from the sinagoge they separate from him by saying he is of age. They spoke this way out of fear. The jews had already agreed that if anyone is attached to Jesus they will be put out of the synagoge, that is why their parents said he is of age. Ask him.

24- 34: They called this man for the second time for a more profound interogation and we can sense the temperature rising but it doesnt work. They failed because they do not understand the power of the Gospel to change. The power to give sight to the blind physically or spiritually. In Verse 24, we tell him to make an oath. The pharasees tell them to GIve glory to GOd. the blind man says I dont know if Jesus was a sinner, but I know I was blind and now I see. The man then says why do you want to know again? Do you want to become their diciples? In verse 28, they reviled him. The simpleton beggar insulted them without trying. "You do not know where this man comes from, but yet he openned my eyes? We know that if someone does the will of God he will be listened... never in the history of the world have we heard of a blind man seeing. He opened my eyes. he is from God". THat is good theology from a simple man. He was casted out. Excommunicated. What his parents where trying to avoid, happened to him. Although he was an outcast in his physical life he became an outcast again but now he sees physically, spiritually but more and more spiritually.

## 3. Beautiful COnfession (35 - 38):

Jesus asks him, do you believe in the son of man? This is a title given by Daniel. Jesus asks, do you believe in the son of man? All he can said is this man Jesus most be a prophet. Do you believe that I am the son of Man? THe blind man was eager to believe. He says, yes, I believe. and he worshipped him. A beautiful confession of one who has eyes to see. The son of man for who he is, the light of man sent by God.

## 4. Obstinate Rejection (39 - 41):

For those who dont believe they are blind, for those who think they see, they will be judged on that acocunt. You have the prohets the knowledge because you see you will be judged by that. What kept the pharasees from seeing what their spiritual blindness, their pride, their lack of understanding of being in the needs of salvation. It is the reality of every unsaved person that dont think they need Jesus because they have their "good works". It is possible to have perfect vision and not see anything. The light of the world that can remove blidnness and have the spiritual glory to see.

### What can we do? With this information?

1. A warning to those who think they see: some of you compare your life to your neighbor and think you are more than them. We need to be like the blind man who realises their blindness and need for someone else to heals us for someone else to give us sight to do the work. Have you recognized that you are a sinner and can you recognized that only he can save you. Have you understood that all things you thought counted for your righteousness is no longer valid worth. You must end up like a blind beggar spiritually speaking before you have eyes to see. Don't be like the pharasees dont be like the nighbors, God will obly accept you in the basis of his work

2. Worship the savior who sees and saves: It is Jesus who has done everything for us. Worship him.

3. Share your story of faith with others: This blind man started simple. I was blind and now I see. You might think you need good theology and understanding in the truth of the Gospel but you have a story. Share it. The time is now before the day runs out and the night has come. It is today that we need to share our story of Jesus Christ. I know nothing except that the man in the cross said I can come. Share your story of faith with others dont be ashamed of how simple it is. You can also share how suffering and interpreting is in your life.

4. Be prepared for some measure of opposition: The church has always suffered. If you have to suffer, if there is opposition in your life you are identifying with Jesus the one who is also reviled. Let that be good enough for you.

5. Live in hope of His coming: on that day when he comes back the blind, the lame, the sick, there will be no more tears, no more crying, no more worries, no more place. No better place to be in .
