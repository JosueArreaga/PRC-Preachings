### Prayer

Jesus is often laughed at and mocked in this world, yet He remains unshakeable. Lord, we are foolish people, and we need Your help. Christ came to us while we were sinners. Let our hearts repent and turn to Your Gospel.

### Sermon:

Today's sermon will focus on a chapter from Exodus:

### Title: God's Provision in the Wilderness

## Introduction

When you look at countries in South America and the U.S., there is no doubt that problems exist, and many believe things will not improve. As a result, I thought it fitting to teach about God's provision in the wilderness, as narrated in Exodus. The book recounts the 40 years in the desert. Deuteronomy was written in the last two months of those 40 years. Many had died in the desert and had never heard the law before.

"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." The people did not understand that their time in the desert was due to the condition of their hearts:

1. To humble them
2. To test them
3. To reveal what was in their hearts
4. To teach that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God

What the people did not realize about the Promised Land was that, to get from point A to point B, they first had to go through the wilderness. The wilderness is often where God chooses to do His best work in His people. Moses spent 80 years in the desert, Jesus was tempted in the desert, and Paul spent roughly 3 years in the desert.

In these barren places, you learn to trust and obey God. He is your only recourse and your only resource. The wilderness may be painful, but it is necessary. We need to understand that we are not going through meaningless experiences if we are being led by God into the wilderness.

Spurgeon said, "If there was a better place for God to take you, you would already be there." In other words, you are on the best path to knowing God better.

### Exodus 16:1â€“12:

**Three things to see:**

1. **Design of the wilderness experience:**

   If you read the Book of Numbers, you will see the consequences of disobedience. The children of Israel arrived in the wilderness of Sin after 30 days. This was the first of seven experiences. The people needed to go through similar experiences seven times. As soon as they reached the desert, they grumbled. It was a congregational grumble. This is why grumbling is like a disease. The congregation followed a pattern, one that still persists today. The word "grumble" translates to "an open rebellion."

   - "If only we had stayed in Egypt, where we had bread until we were full."  
     First and foremost, they were slaves. They glorified the past and condemned the present. Their minds were so clouded by sin that their anger turned against Moses and the kindness of God.

   They said to Moses, "We prefer serving Pharaoh instead of God." In the 40 years they spent in the desert, there was no single expression of gratitude to the Lord. There was also no expression of wanting to pray.

   a) Complaining is an external expression of an ungrateful heart.  
   A complaining spirit always indicates a problem with my relationship with God. The reason for this is because God takes me through life. If God brought them through the desert to humble them, only 30 days were enough to reveal their hearts.

   b) Complaining is an expression of a self-centered heart (Not an Accident).  
   God is sovereign, and He controls everything in the universe. We do not go to the wilderness accidentally.

   God takes you where you need to be, not where you want to be. You may not like it, but it is good for you. That is why the Psalmist says, "It is good for me to be afflicted."

   Every time we sin, knowing that we shouldn't, we have said "yes" to an idol, not to the Lord. Our hearts are full of idols, and as soon as we remove one, another one is built.

   We need to be in certain places so that they create an image in us. Think of two little birds: no one knows who they are or what they do, but Christ says, "Not one of them can die without My permission." In many ways, we don't think of God in this way, but when we do, we learn to trust Him.

   Everyone who is here is meant to be here. Sometimes we hear a sermon and think, "I wish this person had heard it," but it is not for them; it's for you. Horizontally, the people complained against Moses and Aaron, but vertically, they sinned against God.

   No one has ever experienced God's goodness like the people in the desert. They experienced His kindness and provision, yet they were neither surprised, satisfied, nor grateful. God showed them who He was during those 40 years. We can see the contrast between God's patience and the hearts of Israel, always willing to teach His people. Let us not forget that what is spoken down here is heard up there. God hears you grumbling against Him.

   God always takes our complaints personally.

   God takes us into the wilderness to humble us, to test us, to reveal what is in our hearts, and to teach us that we live by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.

   Christ went into the desert to expose His heart. One heart was rebellious, the other was submissive.

   Total trust and obedience are rare, even among the holiest people. Why is it so difficult to trust God completely? Even Adam and Eve didn't trust God before their sinful nature. The answer is that we think God is like us. We assume God's goodness reveals the evil in our hearts.

   Let us be careful how we walk during times of trial. Trials are always a test of obedience. Moses said to them, "No one should keep any of it until the morning." The manna then became infested with worms. Six days you are to gather, but on the seventh day, there will be none. Nevertheless, some people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none. Seriously, take only what you need for today. Don't store up more for tomorrow. Rest.

   How long will you refuse to keep My commandments?

   **REMEMBER**: This is a painful and messy life, but it is not where I will live forever. Why can people go through such horrible situations and still have joy?

   If you are suffering, turn to the Psalms. Someone laments and praises. We lament, but we know that God is better than all of this. Today, we read Psalm 103.
