### Verses : John 8: 12 - 30

### Introduction:

There is a season where most of us a reading the olympics, these things
can be traced back to those days. There was this flame that kept lit.
Historians have understood that the flame originated in the temple of grece.
Until 1936 we brought back the ancient olympic flame. For the 2024 Oylimpics
34 woman at the temple of hera enchanted praises to to her and they lighted
the olympic torch in a religious practice and then the flame was carried out
uninterrupted for it to make it all the way where the olympic games are light
up. The torch remains lit during the neitrity of the games. This flame is
supposed to transmit the following message of peace, and friendship. Eventually
the games are over then the light is put out and countries go back to war and
humanity goes back to their depravity as a sinners.

See humanity for what it is. We know from our passage that the only flame
which can truly bring peace is the flame of Jesus Christ who is the only
true light in the world.

Main Idea: Only Christ can overcome the darkness and give the light of life
to anyone who believes in him.

What was Jesus saying to the pharasees that those around who heard the
conversation where so compelled. These truths woved people in to believe in
Jesus.

## 1. Message of hope:

I am the light of the world whoever follows me will not walk in the light of the darkness.

Jesus has made God known to us but he also leads us towards darkness. You need to understand what is happening within the context of the passage.

When we follow Jesus we no longer walk in spiritual darkness but in
spiritual life for those who walk around us.

light of life: whatever you need he will give to you. You will no longer walk in blindness.

Have you ever been put in a situation inside a dark room and you can't
see a thing? You are anxious, you don't know how to step. Once there
is a light in the room all of a sudden there is a different way of
seeing our circumstances. We will no longer walk in darkness we will
have sufficient light even though the light is not with full intencity
but it is enough for us to no longer walk in darkness. We have enough
light to know the Gospel to fully understand in our hearts. To follow
God is to have sufficient light as to no longer walk in darkness.

Jesus says I am the light of the world whoever follows me will no longer walk in darkness but will have the light of life.

## 2. An opposition that has nothing to offer: Verse 13

As soon as God says I am the light of the world, there was opposition. The pharasees where relentless pn theier oppositiion against Christ. The pharasees had very little to offer they offered the law, rules work-based salvation. They offered the religious instructions. This was not attractive. What Jesus offered was attractive, belive in me you will no longer walk in darkness. Why is it that so many people are converted? Because what the opposition offers eventually runs out.

### Question: when have you seen Godless people satisfied? They never truly

    find what they are looking for. They toil and they strike and they never truly find it. When you see there is great opposition againstthe Lord Jesus do not be affraid.

## 3. A terrifying and sobering reality: 14 - 27

Although the religious leaders know of the history and word they reject Jesus. Jesus says they don't know the true judgment of God. To know God is not based on how much you know. It does not help us to know much if we think we know who God is. How he opperates. You know God when you know on his word who he is and submit to his word not to your ideas to satisfy your flesh

    Isaiah 9: 15:
    What do me is the multitude of your sacrifice ...
    bring no more vein offerings, I cannot endure ...
    your new moons and feasts my soul hates ...
    when you spread out your hand I will hide my eyes
    from you.

Religious people show up to the assembly pios but their heart is far away from the lord.You may want to think you are in good terms with him but those who reject him do not know him and do not know the father. His judgments are right, my judgments are true. For anyone who opposes Jesus you cannot enter heaven. He tells those who reject Jesus you will not come where I am. Listen none of us have a right to Jesus's home and Jesus says that those who reject him cannot come. They don't know who he is where is he comming from. They don't know him or his father and he says this we cannot enter into heaven because you will die in your sin. You will sick him and you will die on your sin. This is what Jesus says

### To these pharasees why does it say you will seek me?

Jesus says these because they seek God in some type of obleque way. Imagine you lose your keys and looking for them you can not find them but they are right under your noses, the sense of desperation of just needing to find him just grow and grow. This is why Jesus says you will seek me but you will never find me. You misses me because I am He and I am infront of you. This is why John says he came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. What is going to happen to those who reject Jesus. You have a long life of hopeless pursuits of God, and at the end of the day you will never find what you are looking for. You will wither away one day in your death bed that you just missed God because you rejected him. You are confronted with Jesus who is the word made flesh. Reject him right now and you will do what these pharasees did here. It is a tragedy to spend your life looking for something that only He can give. The end result is that you will die in your sin. It means that when you die the penalty of your sin will remain on you, you will carry them to the presence of God and the penalty for your sin is death. Many people live their life thinking my sin is not that bad compared to someone who lives like that. You are thinking like someone who rejects jesus The point is not how bad your 'innocent sins' are the point is are your sins accoiunted for by Jesus Christ.

To reject Jesus is to be left on your own to present your sins to a holy GOd. If you reject, if you oppose him, you will die in your sin no matter how pious or religious you think you are. Without him without him who we can follow the light and go way from darkness rest assure you will die in your sin, what did the pharasees do? They rejected him and continued on their belief. To those who listen and believed they woke up. They woke up by knowing the light of Jesus. To be woke is to say that Jesus is the one the only one who can save me from my sin. There is a reality that people have to face. They have to believe that he is the light of the world.
They also saw the terrifying and sovereign reality of not following Jesus it is to die in your sins.

## 4. It is all about the Cross of Christ:

From the very start of the passage to the very end. When you have lifted up the son of man then you will know that I am he. The son of man will be lifted up high. Jesus brings a full sinner to his finished work on the cross. This work is what most clearly defines who is Jesus and what it brings. For those who believe that it is a gift of God. The cross reveals to us the full identity of Jesus it reveals that he is more than just a human that he is the son of God. Then you will know that I am he. When Jesus is lifted up, nailed to a tree. You want to know God you want to be relived on the sin and shame. It is only through the cross of Christ that you can get there. He lived the perfect life that you need and all of it was sufficient for God the father to believe. Believe in the words of jesus. Hearing the words of Jesus, you need to hear them today. Abandone the darkness and come and taste and see. To the believer in this room, walk in the light. You were once darkness you once lived in darkness but if yiu believed in Jesus you are now in the light. Come out of the Shadows if you are hiding, Gods grace is sufficient as he sanctifies you. Live in the light, walk in the light, rejoice in the light. The light is Jesus Christ.
