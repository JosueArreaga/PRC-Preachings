## John Chapter 10: 1 - 21

... This script only contains half of the sermon

### 2. Jesus Leads His Sheep

There is a distinction between how different shepherds lead their sheep. As He is leading the sheep, He is taking them somewhere. He takes them to places where the sheep know they can find comfort. They are at home with the shepherd. They find peace with that shepherd. Psalm 23 comes to mind, verses 1 and 2. David says, "He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul." In Jesus, we can find provision. There is a place where sheep can feed in the grass, and once they are full, they will lie down. Sheep only lie down when they are completely at peace, when they are completely at rest, when they are in the presence of their shepherd.

Sheep get easily frightened. In order for them to drink the water that they need, the water must be still. The Lord leads them to still waters. The shepherd also leads them to paths of righteousness. As sheep normally do, they stray, but the shepherd continues to lead them onward. The Lord is committed to leading us back to the paths of righteousness for His name's sake, that He might be glorified. The Lord shows us our wandering ways so we can repent and have our souls restored and refreshed. If we confess our sins, He is faithful to cleanse us from all our sins.

#### Verses 7:10

Jesus says in this metaphor that He is the gate. The sheepfold doesn’t have a door, so the shepherd lies in the place and serves as the door to protect the sheep. No one can enter the sheepfold without going through the shepherd.

### 3. Jesus Promises Salvation and Abundant Life for His Sheep

Jesus plays the role of the shepherd and the door. If anyone enters by Him, he will be saved and will go in and out, find pasture, and be safe. This language is closely tied to Him. He says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me." Jesus says that He is the door. He is the way, the truth, and the life. He contrasts Himself again with the Pharisees and says, "All those who came before Me are thieves and robbers." This refers to the Pharisees. He is not referring to the Old Testament; that is not what He had in mind here. He refers to the thieves and robbers who promise salvation outside of Jesus.

The promises that the Pharisees and others made were not rooted in Christ. Those promises end in destruction.

Church, there is nothing more harmful than telling someone that salvation can be found outside of God. While you may not say these things with your words, you may say them with your actions. You may tell your kids that salvation is through grace, but you show salvation that is based on legalism.

Jesus came that we may have life and have it abundantly. The idea of abundant life is a life that is overflowing. It's not just a life spent here on earth. Some of you may say, "I don’t even know where to start." Let me tell you, you learn to start when you see that you are a sinner. That you are not perfect, not good. If you don’t have that hope or peace, you need to find that in Jesus. The reality is that we deserve pain and punishment for our sins, but if we repent and approach Him, He promises life. For those of you here today who may say, "I don’t have that, I don’t know how," please approach the pastors. We are here for you.

Here, Jesus offers life to His followers.

### Metaphor 3: Jesus as the Good Shepherd (11 - 18)

He does what is good for others, not what is good for Himself. Jesus lays down His life for His sheep. There is a comparison between Him and the hired hand. The hired hand does not care about the sheep; it is easy for him to run away. He flees because he does not care about the sheep. In contrast, Jesus, who is the Good Shepherd, lays down His life for His sheep. He is willing to give it all up for His sheep. The idea of a shepherd dying for the sheep is contrary to what a shepherd would normally do. The goal of the shepherd is to stay alive so he can continue to care for the sheep.

### 4. Jesus Lays Down His Life for His Sheep

Hebrews 12, verse 2, speaks about Jesus: "For the joy set before Him, He endured the cross." The ugliness of the cross never changed His willingness to go through with it. No one takes His life; He gives it up. He lays down His life, and the Father loves Him for that. He also speaks of the Gentiles: "I have other sheep besides this fold. I must bring them in also, and there will be one fold." The Jews and Gentiles, no matter how different, are brought together. No matter the polar opposites, no matter the sin you may have, Jesus never gives up on His people. He has a never-ending love for His sheep. Church, think of this for a second: You may have a hard time imagining someone taking a punch on your behalf, but their life?

In our arrogance, we say, "I know how to do life my way, and I don’t need You." It couldn’t be further from the truth. Praise God for those of us who know Him. We know He leads us in paths of righteousness, promises abundant life, and shed His blood for us that we may live. Church, through these three metaphors, we have learned a lot. So what is an appropriate response? The first response, without a doubt, is worship. Everything about you—He still loves you. You don’t need to put on a mask because He loves you intimately. We get to live so that we may glorify Him.

Rest in the fact that your salvation is not dependent on you. Jesus accomplished all of this on the cross at Calvary. Some of you today, even after knowing God has saved you and changed you, when you see sin in your life, you think your salvation changes. God redeemed you once and for all. You are not constantly earning your salvation. Are you the door? The Good Shepherd? No, you are the sheep. You are not able to do anything or bring anything to the table. We bring all liabilities, and He brings all the assets. This may sound harsh, but for anyone faithful to the Word, I am not here to tell you something to make you feel good about yourself; I am here to tell you how good God is, despite how bad we are. Not because we earned it in any way, but because we have been loved with an eternal love. I am reminded of a song called "His Forever." It refers to how Jesus is a friend of sinners.

So Church, with this said, I hope this reminds you that no death, life, or anything else can separate us from the love that will not let us go. Church, if you know Him as Lord and Savior, nothing will change that. Church, let’s pray.
